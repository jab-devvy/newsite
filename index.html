        <!-- Introduction Section -->
        <h4>Hi, I'm Alex. I like IT and am an aspiring sysadmin.</h4>
        <p>I first got into IT by trying (and failing) to install Linux on a locked-down school computer, which led to a deeper dive into things like BIOS and CPU architectures while trying to get Ubuntu running on an old iBook.  That initial spark ignited a general interest in computers that's been a consistent thread throughout my life and career.</p>
